## ✨ About This Project

This website was built by Emma Dunn using modern web technologies. Rather than using template-based platforms, I chose to code it myself to have complete creative control over the design, performance, and user experience. This approach allows for custom features, optimal loading speeds, and a unique aesthetic that reflects my personal brand.

## 📁 Features

- Responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices
- Accessible, semantic HTML following web standards
- Custom navigation and theming

- Blog platform with content management
- Photography gallery with image optimization
